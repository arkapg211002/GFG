<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/linkedlist-josephus-circle/1?page=1&difficulty=Medium&status=unsolved&sortBy=accuracy">LinkedList Josephus Circle</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Medium</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">You are given two integers <strong>n</strong> and <strong>k</strong> where n represents the total number of people who are standing in a circle, and k represents the person who gets killed in each iteration.<br></span><span style="font-size: 18px;">You need to find which person is the last man standing. The indexing here starts from zero. The counting starts from the zero<sup>th</sup> person and after each killing, the counting resets and start from the next neighbor of the killed person.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Example:</span></strong></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>n = 7, k = 3
<strong>Output: </strong>3</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Explanation:<br></strong>With 7 people in the circle [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], counting every 3rd person:<br>First, person 2 is killed: circle becomes [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]<br>Second, person 5 is killed: circle becomes [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]<br>Third, person 1 is killed: circle becomes [0, 3, 4, 6]<br>Next, person 6 is killed: circle becomes [0, 3, 4]<br>Next, person 4 is killed: circle becomes [0,3]<br>Finally, person 0 is killed, leaving 3 as the last person standing</span></pre>
