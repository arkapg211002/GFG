Let x be an element in the array with the maximum frequency. The task is to find the smallest sub-segment of the array which also has x as the maximum frequency element.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Note:</strong> If two or more elements have the same frequency (i.e., maximum frequency) and the same sub-segment size then print the sub-segment<strong> </strong>which occurs first in the array.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
<strong>Output :</strong> [2, 2]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Note that there are two elements that appear two times, 1 and 2. The smallest window for 1 is whole array and smallest window for 2 is [2, 2]. Since window for 2 is smaller, this is our output.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 5] <strong>
Output :</strong> [3, 3] <br><strong>Explanation: </strong></span><span style="font-size: 18px;">In this array, both 3 and 5 have the highest frequency of 2. However, the sub-segment [3, 3] occurs earlier in the array than [5, 5], so the correct output is [3, 3].</span></pre>
