One of their specialities is related to producing offspring. A cow in FooLand produces its first calve (female calf) at the age of <strong>two years</strong> and proceeds to produce other calves (one female calf a year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Now the farmer Harold wants to know how many animals he would have at the end of <strong>n</strong> years, if we assume that none of the calves dies, given that initially, he has only one female calf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>n = 2
<strong>Output: </strong>2
<strong>Explanation: </strong>At the end of 1 year, he will have only 1 cow, at the end of 2 years he will have 2 animals (one parent cow C1 and other baby calf B1 which is the offspring of cow C1).</span>
</pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>n = 4
<strong>Output: </strong>5
<strong>Explanation: </strong></span><span style="font-size: 18px;">At the end of 1 year, he will have only 1 cow, at the end of 2 years he will have 2 animals (one parent cow C1 and other baby calf B1 which is the offspring of cow C1). At the end of 3 years, he will have 3 animals (one parent cow C1 and 2 female calves B1 and B2, C1 is the parent of B1 and B2).At the end of 4 years,he will have 5 animals (one parent cow C1, 3 offsprings of C1 i.e. B1, B2, B3 and one offspring of B1).</span>
